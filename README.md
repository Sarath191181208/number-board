# number-board
it's a simple game in which you have an board
your goal is to find a number lets say 'N'

each time you select a block 
if you have chosen a blank one it lights up
for each block you chose lets say it has a number 'c' on it 
another block lights lets say which has 'l' on it
which indicates sum or difference of the number i.e
l+c = N or |c-l| = N
or its the difference of distance from the position of c
